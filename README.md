# soccer-league
This is the first static site I created as the first assignment during the coding bootcamp. 
It's a website for a local Chicago soccer league for kids where the user can register, read rules, look up game information and game locations. The primary goal of this project was to learn CSS Grid and CSS Flexbox, which is why the design is only for desktop screens. 

Technologies used: HTML5. CSS3 (CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, CSS Animation).
